# Adaptation for multi-user collaboration (MUC)
This repositoty provides results from a our study on 88 accessibility settings,
potential configuration conflicts and appropriate	solutions when preferences of
multiple user cannot be activated in parallel, as that would lead to an inadequate
or inaccessible user interfaces for one or all users. 

## Overview of the Files

## Background information:
Personal computers, mobile devices, or home entertainment systems are customizable
with respect to individual needs and preferences and many of nowadays supported
settings can help people with serve or mild impairments to betteruse technology,
for instance, by configuring the screen resolution, the colour contrast, or the system volume.
Advances in User Interface Adaptation (UIA) have made it possible to tailor applications
to individual needs automatically, e.g. the Cloud4all	personalization framework enables to
auto-configure any device to individual accessibility requirements.

An aspect which had previously received little attention is to automatically
personalize a user interface in a way that suits the needs and preferences of
multiple users and facilitates cooperative and simultaneous usage of a device.
Cases where devices are shared simultaneously occur, for instance, 
when students need to work in pairs, when family members or residents of a nursing
home watch TV together, or when multiple visitors of a museum use a large-scale
interactive surface in parallel. In those	situations, users with disabilities 
may face barriers when information technologies are inaccessible but also when one
user requires a setting or assistive technology that contradict with the requirements 
of another user.

Our study is on conflicting configuration policies that need to be detected and
resolved when devices and user interfaces are automatically adapted to multiple
users with contradicting accessibility preferences to enable cooperative usage.
