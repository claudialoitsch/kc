# Adaptation for multi-user collaboration (MUC)
	
	This repositoty provides results from a our study on 88 accessibility settings, potential configuration conflicts and appropriate solutions when preferences of multiple user cannot be activated in parallel, as that would lead to an inadequate or inaccessible user interfaces for one or all users. 

	Background information: Personal computers, mobile devices, or home entertainment systems are customizable with respect to individual needs and preferences and many of nowadays supported settings can help people with serve or mild impairments to better use technology, for instance, by configuring the screen resolution, the colour contrast, or the system volume. Advances in User Interface Adaptation (UIA) have made it possible to tailor applications to individual needs automatically, e.g. the Cloud4all personalization framework enables to auto-configure any device to individual accessibility requirements. 

	An aspect which had previously received little attention is to automatically personalize a user interface in a way that suits the needs and preferences of multiple users and facilitates cooperative and simultaneous usage of a device. Cases where devices are shared simultaneously occur, for instance, when students need to work in pairs, when family members or residents of a nursing home watch TV together, or when multiple visitors of a museum use a large-scale interactive surface in parallel. In those situations, users with disabilities may face barriers when information technologies are inaccessible but also when one user requires a setting or assistive technology that contradict with the requirements of another user.
